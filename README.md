# Remote-Control-Winch
Remote Control of an agricultural Winch


This project consists of 3 individulal parts:

+ Remote (mobile transmitter)
+ Receiver (mounted on the winch)
+ an optional tilt sensor

I used Atom with Atom editor to write the code. Each folder should include all relevant information.

Safety and Warranty

An agricultural winch can be very dangerous, please be extremely cautious during your work in the woods.
