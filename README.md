# Remote-Control-Winch
Remote Control of an agricultural Winch


This project consists of 3 individulal parts:

+ Remote (mobile transmitter)
+ Receiver (mounted on the winch)
+ an optional tilt sensor

I used PlatformIO witch Atom editor to write the code. Each folder should include all relevant information.
